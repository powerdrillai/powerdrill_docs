After [creating your team](/enterprise/workspaces#create-a-workspace) on Powerdrill Enterprise, you'll receive 100 free jobs for a one-month trial and 100 MB of permanent free Workspace capacity storage.

However, you may need to subscribe to or upgrade your plans when using Powerdrill Enterprise's API in the following cases:

- [You have used up your free job quota](#upgrade-your-free-job-plan).

    Once the 100 free jobs are used or the 1-month trial ends, no job quota remains. Upgrade to a paid plan to continue using Powerdrill Enterprise.

- [You want to expand your team](#upgrade-your-workspace-capacity-plan).

    Users can run jobs only when linked to a job subscription, and each subscription supports one user. To add more users in your team, you need additional job subscriptions.


- [Your Workspace capacity is full](#create-additional-subscriptions).

    The free Workspace capacity storage is limited to 100 MB. If your team's data reaches this limit, upgrade your Workspace capacity plan to increase storage space.


In this guide, we'll show you how to upgrade your free plan and create additional job subscriptions.

<Tip>

 Please note that all operations related to subscriptions are complete on your admin console. 
 For more information about job and Workspace capacity plans, see [Pricing](/enterprise/pricing.mdx).

  <Tip>
  There are two subscription types available:

  - **Monthly subscription**: Recurs on a monthly basis.
  - **One-time purchase**: Non-recurring and expires after the set period.
  
  When deciding on the number of subscriptions, consider how many users in your team need to run jobs. Ensure that the number of subscriptions matches the number of users in your team.
  </Tip>


4. Once the payment is successful, you can manage your subscriptions on the **Subscriptions & plans** page.
