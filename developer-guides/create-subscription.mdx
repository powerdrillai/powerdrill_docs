After [creating your team](/enterprise/workspaces#create-a-workspace) on Powerdrill Enterprise, you'll receive 100 free jobs for a one-month trial and 100 MB of permanent free Workspace capacity storage.

However, you may need to subscribe to or upgrade your plans when using Powerdrill Enterprise's API in the following cases:

- [You have used up your free job quota](#create-subscriptions).

    Once the 100 free jobs are used or the 1-month trial ends, no job quota remains. Subscribe to a paid plan to continue using Powerdrill Enterprise.

- [You want to expand your team](#create-subscriptions).

    Users in your team can run jobs only when linked to a job subscription, and each subscription can be associated with only one user. To add more users in your team, you need additional job subscriptions.


- [Your Workspace capacity is full](#upgrade-your-workspace-capacity-plan).

    The free Workspace capacity storage is limited to 100 MB. If your team's data reaches this limit, upgrade your Workspace capacity plan to increase storage space.


- [The job quota offered by a specific subscription is insufficient](#upgrade-job-subscriptions).

   If the allocated job quota for a subscription is not enough, you need to upgrade the subscription to meet your usage needs.



In this guide, we'll show you how to upgrade your free plan and create additional job subscriptions.

  <Tip>
  There are two subscription types available:

  - **Monthly subscription**: Recurs on a monthly basis.
  - **One-time purchase**: Non-recurring and expires after the set period.
  
  When deciding on the number of subscriptions, consider how many users in your team need to run jobs. Ensure that the number of subscriptions matches the number of users in your team.
