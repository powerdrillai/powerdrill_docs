## Step 1: Sign in to Powerdrill

To start your Powerdrill journey, first you need to sign in to Powerdrill.

1. Visit https://powerdrill.ai/ and click **Sign In** in the upper-right corner.
2. In the **Sign In to Powerdrill** dialog box, select a sign-in method and click **Sign In**.
    You can sign in with your Google or GitHub account if you have one. 
    
    Alternatively, you can enter your email address to sign in. After you enter your email address and click **Sign In**, a confirmation email will be sent to you. You need to log in to the given email and confirm the sign-in.

## Step 2: Import your data

After sign-in, you can create your dataset and import your data. 

1. On the Powerdrill console, choose **Datasets** from the left-side bar and click the **+ Dataset** button on the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Create Dataset** page, specify the dataset name and description and click **Continue**.
    You can choose whether to select the **Accessible as a ChatGPT Plugin** option. If selected, the dataset will be available on third-party platforms.
3. Associate the dataset with the Apps that you want to allow access to data sources in the dataset and click **Continue**.
4. Choose a data source type, configure the data source, and click **Finish**. Alternatively, you can directly click **Skip and Finish** to create an empty dataset and import data sources later.

    Powedrill supports various data source types, including plain text, web pages, and files in PDF, CSV, JSON, Text, PowerPoint, Word, or Excel format.

5. Configure the data source and click **Finish**.

You can skip this step and jump to [Step 3](#step-3-extract-intelligence-from-your-data) to directly use Powerdrill to start inquiries with ChatGPT. However, we recommend that you import your data so that you can have tailored experience of certain Powerdrill features based on your own data.



## Step 3: Extract intelligence from your data

After configuring the dataset, you can use the associated App to start exploring intelligence from your data.



1. Open the App.

    Method 1: On the **Datasets** page, click the App name in the **Associated Apps** column of the dataset. If multiple Apps are associated, click the **Associated Apps Details** button to select the target App.

    Method 2: On the left-side bar, choose **Apps**. On the **Apps** page that appears, select the desired App.

2. Ask any questions about your data to see what insights the App can bring to you.


## Step 4: (Optional) Share your data

After you create a dataset, you can share it with those who you trust in a pretty simple way.

1. On the **Datasets** page, find the dataset you want to share, click the share button in the **Actions** column.
2. In the **Invite** dialog box, specify the access mode, set the validity period, and specify the emails to receive an invitation or click **Generate Invitation** to copy the invitation information to the invitees.

Note that if you want to stop sharing a dataset, specify its access mode to **Stop sharing**.
