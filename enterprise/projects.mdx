## What is a project?

Projects are focused, purpose-driven groups within your organization. You can create multiple projects based on your specific needs.

While all projects share the same pool of Workspace capacity, each project functions as a data-isolated environment. This means datasets created in one project are inaccessible to other projects, enabling you to maintain granular control over data security and ensure clear boundaries between projects.
