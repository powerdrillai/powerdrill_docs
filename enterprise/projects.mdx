## What is a project?

Projects are focused, purpose-driven groups within your organization. You can create multiple projects based on your specific needs.

While all projects share the same pool of Workspace capacity, each project functions as a data-isolated environment. This means datasets created in one project are inaccessible to other projects, enabling you to maintain granular control over data security and ensure clear boundaries between projects.






## Create a project

You can create projects within the team you own.

1. Sign in to Powerdrill.

2. Click your profile icon in the lower-left corner.

3. In the menu, go to the **Workspace** section and click **Switch Workspace**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/enterprise/img/switch-workspace.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

    A list of all the workspaces you're in will appear.

4. Click the **Admin console** next to the team that you own.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/enterprise/img/enter-admin.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

5. On the top-navigation bar, select **Projects**. On the **Projects** page, click **Create a project**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/enterprise/img/create-project.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

6. Set the project name and click **Create**.

You can now add users or manage API keys to control access to your project's resources.

## FAQ

### Can I delete unnecessary projects?

No. Currently you cannot delete projects from your team.


### What's the difference between project API keys and team API keys?

They serve for different purposes. 

- **Project API keys**: Obtained from the **Projects** page, they are used for authenticating operations to resources within specific projects.  

- **Team API keys**: Obtained from the **Settings** page, they are used for authenticating actions related to creating or modifying projects within your team.  



### How do I manage datasets and data sources in a project?

1. Click your profile icon, and click **Switch Workspaces**.

2. Click the project card to enter the project. Then, you will see the homepage of the project.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/enterprise/img/project-homepage.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>


3. In the left sidebar, select **Datasets**. From there, you can manage your datasets and data sources in each dataset as needed.
