Data agents are AI-powered analysts built to intelligently manage your data jobs. While Powerdrill Enterprise in general mode offers robust data analytics capabilities, the data agents take it a step further with superior performance, thanks to these advanced capabilities:

- Reasoning

- Abstraction

Suppose you have a data agent customized for your HR department. Not only does it inherit the advanced capabilities of the LLMs it leverages, but it also learns and incorporates your domain-specific knowledge. Trained as a recruitment assistant, it can streamline tasks like finding candidates for a prompt engineering position. All you need to do is ask it a question, such as:

```
Assist me in identifying the top 5 candidates for a prompt engineering position.
```

Then, simply wait for the results. The data agent will analyze your requirements, source resumes that match your criteria from the channels you've pre-integrated via APIs or other tools, and deliver a ranked list of 5 resumes. Each resume will include a candidate introduction, highlighting their strengths and potential drawbacks.
