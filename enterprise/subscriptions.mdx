## Subscribe to a plan

### Subscribe to a job plan

Since users in your team can only run jobs after being associated with a pricing plan, it's important to understand the number of users in your team and their estimated job usage.

If you're unsure, no worries. You can subscribe to a plan later as needed. Start with the Tier 1 plan, and when a user exceeds the job quota, you can easily upgrade their plan to meet their requirements.

To subscribe a job plan, perform the following:

1. On the top navigation bar in the Admin console, select **Subscriptions & plans**. 

2. On the page that appears, click **Subscribe**.

3. On the **Select plan** page, choose the subscription type, select the plan, and set the number of subscriptions you want to make, and click **Confirm**.

    </Frame>

  <Tip>
  There are two subscription types available:

  - **Monthly subscription**: Recurs on a monthly basis.
  - **One-time purchase**: Non-recurring and expires after the set period.
  
  When deciding on the number of subscriptions, consider how many users in your team need to run jobs. Ensure that the number of subscriptions matches the number of users in your team.
  </Tip>


4. Once the payment is successful, you can manage your subscriptions on the Subscriptions & Plans page.


### Subscribe to a Workspace capacity plan

Each team receives 100 MB of free Workspace capacity upon creation. If your team's needs exceed this capacity, you can subscribe to a paid plan.

1. In the Admin console, select **Usage & billing** from the top navigation bar.

2. In the **Workspace capacity** section, click **Upgrade**.

    </Frame>

3. On the **Select capacity plan** page, choose your desired plan and click **Upgrade**.

    <Tip>
     Since your team shares the same pool of Workspace capacity (not tied to user or project), only one subscription to the target plan is needed. 
    </Tip>

4. After the payment is processed, you can manage your subscriptions on the **Subscriptions & plans** page.
