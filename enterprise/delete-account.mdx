Deleting the admin account is a critical action, as it is closely tied to your organization. To proceed, you must first delete your entire organization. We strongly advise against this operation unless it is absolutely necessary. Please carefully consider the impacts before taking this operation.

If you still wish to delete your admin account, follow the steps below.

## Step 1. Delete your organization

Deleting your organization is a serious action and cannot be undone. We strongly recommend carefully considering whether it's absolutely necessary before proceeding. Please make sure this is the right decision for your team and data.

<Warning>
Once you delete your organization, the following will be lost:

- All users will be removed from the team.

- All subscription records will be deleted.

- All projects and datasets within those projects will be removed.

- Credit card information will be deleted.

- Usage and billing data will be erased.
</Warning>


If you still wish to delete your organization, please follow these steps in the Admin console:

## Step 2. Unsubcribe from your Powerdrill Personal Edition Plan

After deleting your organization, check if you are subscribed to any pricing plan under the Powerdrill Personal Edition. If so, make sure to unsubscribe before proceeding. If not, skip this step.

1. Click your profile icon on the upper-right corner of the page and click **Switch Workspaces**.
