## What is a workspace?

A workspace is a dedicated Powerdrill environment with its own settings, members, and resources. 

Users can access multiple workspaces, such as a personal workspace and a Powerdrill Enterprise workspace. Each workspace is tailored to meet different needs and functions.

---

## What is a team?

A team is the virtual representation of a Powerdrill Enterprise workspace. 

Each account can create only one team but can be invited to join multiple teams as a user. This means an account can be the owner of just one team.

## How can I create a workspace?

**Personal Workspace:**

2. Click your profile icon in the lower-left corner.

3. In the menu, go to the **Workspace** section and click **Create team**.


4. Enter your organization name, agree to the *Terms of Service* and *Privacy Policy*, and click **Continue**.
