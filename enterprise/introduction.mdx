Your team on Powerdrill serves as your organization's dedicated AI workspace. Once you create your organization on Powerdrill, Powerdrill automatically create a default project for running jobs, along with 100 MB of Workspace capacity shared across all projects. 

<Info>

Currently, only the default project is available. Soon, we'll introduce the ability to create multiple projects. While all projects share the same pool of Workspace capacity, each project functions as a data-isolated environment. This means datasets created in one project are inaccessible to other projects, enabling you to maintain granular control over data security and ensure clear boundaries between projects.

</Info>

Within your project, you can either use the general mode to run jobs and gain insights from your data or create dedicated data agents (coming soon) for more tailored analysis.
