Your team serves as your organization's virtual representation in Powerdrill Enterprise.

After creating your team, Powerdrill Enterprise automatically generates a default project for adding data, managing users, and running jobs.

You can create as many projects as needed. While all projects share a common pool of Workspace capacity, each project operates in its own isolated environment. This ensures users and datasets in one project are inaccessible to others, providing granular control over data security and clear boundaries between projects.
