## The Settings tab


On the **Settings** tab, there are three sections:

- **Basic information**

- **Payment settings**

- **DANGER ZONE**


In the **Basic information** section, you can update your organization name and view the admin's email account.

<Tip>
 You can only view the admin account; it cannot be changed.
</Tip>


In the **Payment settings** section, you can add a credit card as your payment method if one hasn't been configured yet. You can also update your payment method here.

In the **DANGER ZONE** section, you have the option to delete your organization. **This action is highly discouraged**â€”once deleted, all data, including datasets and job execution history, will be permanently erased and cannot be recovered under any circumstances. Proceed with extreme caution.

## The Team API keys tab

The **Team API keys** tab allows you to manage your team API keys. These keys are used for authentication in operations related to project management, such as creating or modifying projects.

When creating an API key, make sure to save the generated secret key, as it will only be displayed once on the console. If you forget or lose it, the only option is to create a new key.
