## Manage general settings


On the **Settings** tab, there are three sections:

- **Basic information**

- **Payment settings**

- **DANGER ZONE**


In the **Basic information** section, you can update your organization name and view the admin's email account.

<Tip>
 You can only view the admin account; it cannot be changed.
</Tip>


In the **Payment settings** section, you can add a credit card as your payment method if one hasn't been configured yet. You can also update your payment method here.

To change a credit card, perform the following steps:

1. Click **Change credit card**. 

2. In the dialog box that is displayed, enter your new credit card, and click **Change credit card.**


In the **DANGER ZONE** section, you have the option to delete your organization. **This action is highly discouraged**â€”once deleted, all assets in your team, including datasets and job execution history, will be permanently erased and cannot be recovered under any circumstances. Proceed with extreme caution.

## The Team API keys tab

The **Team API keys** tab allows you to manage your team API keys. These keys are used for authentication in operations related to project management, such as creating or modifying projects.

When creating an API key, make sure to save the generated secret key, as it will only be displayed once on the console. If you forget or lose it, the only option is to create a new key.

## FAQ

### What should I do if the system prompts me to check my payment settings?

If the system prompts you to check your payment settings, it means the credit card currently set for payment is unavailable. To avoid any service interruptions, please update your payment method by following these steps:

1. On the Admin console of your team, select **Settings** from the top navigation bar.

2. In the **Payment settings** section, click **Change credit card**.

3. In the dialog that appears, enter the new credit card details and click **Change credit card**.

Your new credit card will replace the old one for payment.


### How can I delete my organization?

Deleting your organization is a serious action and cannot be undone. We strongly recommend carefully considering whether it's absolutely necessary before proceeding. Please make sure this is the right decision for your team and data.

    Go to the **Subscriptions & plans** page, choose **Manage** > **Unsubscribe** in the **Actions** column for each subscription, and confirm the operation.

- **Project API keys**: Obtained from the **Projects** page, they are used for authenticating operations to resources within specific projects.
