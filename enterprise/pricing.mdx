## FAQ


### What is a job?

A job represents a task that Powerdrill completes to generate a response to a user-initiated request (such as a prompt or other workflows).

The figure below illustrates the flow of a job initiated through an API call.

</Frame>


Upon initiating an API call, a job begins:

1. Identify user intent.

2. Create an execution plan for the task.

3. Execute the task, where Powerdrill interacts with the user's dataset to generate output aligned with the user's intent, utilizing LLM capabilities.
