# Pricing

Powerdrill Enterprise provides flexible pricing options tailored to your solution choice. Before subscribing, consider these two core billing factors, applicable to both **SaaS Team** and **Cloud Deployment** options:

- - **Jobs**: Each job is completed when a message is sent and a response is received, whether through a data agent, API call, or within a private Powerdrill deployment.

- **Workspace Capacity**: refers to the allocated size of your hybrid store, which includes offline indexing, vector storage and retrieval, and enterprise-grade data security.
