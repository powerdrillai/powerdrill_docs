## What is a user?

A user in Powerdrill Enterprise is an individual who has access to a workspace within the Powerdrill Enterprise environment. 


---


## User types

Powerdrill Enterprise Edition provides three types of users, each designed with varying permissions to meet diverse requirements:

- **Team member**: A team member is a user with full access to all features on the console. They collaborate with other team members, managing and interacting with data within the projects they are part of. 

    Team members can perform the following operations in projects where they hold membership:

    - Create and manage datasets and data sources

    - Run jobs based on the datasets

    - Collaborate with other team members



    <Tip>
    Team members are ideal for teams using Powerdrill Enterprise as their AI-driven data analytics platform, empowering each individual to optimize data analysis based on their personalized needs.

    Team members do not have access to the Powerdrill Open API, as it is unnecessary for their role.
    </Tip>

- **System user**: A system user can utilize the Powerdrill Open API to run jobs in large batches, but does not have access to the memory feature.

    System users can perform the following operations in projects where they hold membership:

    - Leverage Powerdrill Enteprise's AI capabilties via API calls.

    - Run jobs in batches efficienctly.

    - Develop custom solutions via the Powerdrill Open API to serve their users.

    <Tip>
    System users are ideal for your organization's developers, data engineers, and technical personnel who need to automate tasks, run jobs in large batches, or integrate Powerdrill's AI capabilities into their custom applications. They are best suited for scenarios requiring API-driven operations or secondary development to extend services to end-users.
    </Tip>

- **Virtual users**: A virtual user can use the Powerdrill Open API to run jobs, with access to the memory feature. 

    <Tip>
    Virtual users are best suited for external customers or clients of your organization who need controlled access to specific features of Powerdrill. They are ideal for scenarios where users require API-based functionality along with access to the memory feature. Virtual users ensure a secure and tailored experience without exposing unnecessary details about Powerdrill.
    </Tip>

## Manage project memberships for a user

On the **Users** page, you can add a user to or remove a user from projects.

<Warning>
Users not added to any projects will face the following limitations when using Powerdrill Enterprise:
- Unable to upload data sources or create datasets.
- Cannot specify datasets for question answering. 

Therefore, we highly recommend you to add users to the appropriate projects to fully utilize Powerdrill Enterprise's data analysis capabilities.
</Warning>

## Manage the subscription for a user

You can associate a user with a subscription to grant them job credits for processing data tasks on Powerdrill. You can also unassociate the subscription from the user to prevent them from consuming the job credits provided by the subscription.

<Tip>
 Only users linked to a subscription can run jobs in Powerdrill Enterprise. To know more about managing your subscriptions, see [Subscriptions](/enterprise/subscriptions).
</Tip>

1. On the **Users** page, locate the target user in the list and click the Expand icon in the **Associated Plan** column.

2. In the dialog box that appears, select the pricing tier and the ID of an unassigned subscription, then click **Confirm**.

  To unassociate a subscription from a user, simply deselect the assigned subscription and click **Confirm**.

</Warning>

1. On the **Users** page, locate the unnecesary user, and click the Delete icon in the **Actions** column.
