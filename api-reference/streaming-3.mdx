However, if streaming is disabled, Powerdrill returns the response only after the entire response is ready.

Let's use the same request as an example for a clear comparison. The only difference is that `stream` is set to `False`.


```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://ai.data.cloud/api/v1/job"

payload = json.dumps({
  "datasetId": "cm3my37en3q36017q7x3hyyf4",
  "datasourceIdList": [
    "cm3myfsfc03jn011csb8wah6p"
  ],
  "languageType": "EN",
  "question": "How do 'Digital Services for Taxpayers' scores vary across economies, and which economy has the most advanced digital services?",
  "sessionId": "4440ab38-3df0-465b-a66c-bf6acb0f1bc2",
  "stream": False
})
headers = {
  'x-pd-api-key': '$PD_API_KEY',
  'x-pd-api-agent-id': 'GENERAL',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```
