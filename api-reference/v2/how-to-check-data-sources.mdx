Powerdrill lets you upload multiple data sources to a dataset, making it easier to organize your data files. However, any data sources that are not synchronized at the time a job starts will be excluded from analysis or exploration.

To ensure all data sources are used in data analysis, make sure they are fully synchronized before executing data jobs. Here's how:


---


## 1. Call the endpoint


Send a request to the [Get status summary of data sources in dataset
](/api-reference/v2/get-dataset-status) endpoint.

Following is a request example:

<Tip>
Set `id` to the dataset ID, `user_id` to your user ID, and `x-pd-api-key` to the API key of the target project.
</Tip>


```python Python
import requests

url = "https://ai.data.cloud/api/v2/team/datasets/{id}/status?user_id=tmm-dafasdfasdfasdf"

headers = {"x-pd-api-key": "<api-key>"}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

---

## 2. Check the result

Then, review the returned response:


```json Example response
{
  "code": 0,
  "data": {
    "synched_count": 5,
    "invalid_count": 0,
    "synching_count": 0
  }
}
```


If both `invalid_count` and `synching_count` are `0`, all data sources in the dataset are fully synchronized and ready to be used by Powerdrill. Otherwise, any unsynchronized sources will not be available for analysis.
