Powerdrill Enterprise uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the result of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success; codes in the `4xx` range indicate client-side errors (for example, invalid arguments); codes in the `5xx` range indicate server-side errors (these are rare).

## API errors

| Code | Meaning |
| :- | :- |
| `400 Bad Request` | Invalid parameters provided. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid API key. |
| `402 Request Failed` | The parameters were valid, but the request couldn't be completed. |
| `403 Forbidden` | The API key lacks the necessary permissions to perform this action. |
| `404 Not Found` | The requested resource doesn't exist. |
| `409 Conflict` | The request conflicts with another (for example, using the same idempotent key). |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Too many requests sent in a short time. We recommend implementing exponential backoff. |
| `500, 502, 503, 504 Server Errors` | Something went wrong on Powerdrill's end (rare). |

## Error types

| Error type | Description |
| :- | :- |
| `authentication_error` | An authentication error indicates your API key is invalid, expired, or revoked. This could be caused by a typo, formatting mistake, or a potential security issue. |
| `invalid_request_error` | Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters. |
| `internal_server_error` | An internal server error indicates something went wrong on our end while processing your request. This could be due to a temporary issue, a bug, or a system outage. |
| `idempotency_error` | Idempotency errors occur when the same Idempotency-Key is used for a request with a different API endpoint or set of parameters than the original request. |
| `rate_limit_error` | A rate limit error indicates you've exceeded your assigned rate limit. This occurs when you've sent too many requests within a certain time frame, and our services have temporarily blocked your further requests. |
| `permission_error` | You are not authorized to do this operation. (Action: %s, Resource: %s.) |
