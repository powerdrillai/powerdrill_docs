## Step 1. Get your API key

<Warning>
The Powerdrill Enterprise Open API is currently in beta. Join our waitlist by emailing us at contact@powerdrill.ai. Once approved, you'll receive a confirmation email promptly.
</Warning>

1. Sign in to [Powerdrill](https://powerdrill.ai) with the email that you've used to join our waitlist. 

2. Visit https://powerdrill.ai/teamspace.

3. On the page that is displayed, set your orginzation name, read and agree with our Terms of Service and Privacy Notice, and click **Continue**.

    </Frame>

4. Connect to your credit card as prompted. You will then be directed to the Teamspace page.

    <Info>
      Your credit card won't be charged unless you purchase a subscription.
    </Info>
    
5.  Navigate to the **API** tab, click **+ API access key** to generate an API key, and make sure to save it securely, as it will only be displayed once on the Powerdrill platform.

     <img src="/images/create-api-key.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

    <Warning>
      **Keep your API key SECRET.** Never share it or include it in client-side code, such as browsers or apps. For production use, ensure all requests are routed through your backend server, where the API key can be securely accessed from an environment variable or a key management service.
    </Warning>

## Step 2. Create a session

To create a session, make a request to the [POST /v1/sessions](api-reference/create-session) endpoint. Sessions are essential for running jobs on Powerdrill, as each job must be linked to a session using its session ID.


**Example request**:

```python

```

<Info>

- Replace the `x-pd-api-key` value with the API key you've obtained in [step 1](#step-1-get-your-api-key). 

- Since this topic covers running a general job, set the `x-pd-api-agent-id` header to `GENERAL` (uppercase).

</Info>


**Example response**:

```python

```

Obtain the `id` value (session ID) from the response and save it for use in the following step.




## (Optional) Step 3. Create a data source and a dataset

<Warning>
 This step is optional but highly recommended, as it allows you to receive insights tailored to your own data.
</Warning>

Data sources are the data you upload to Powerdrill for embedding and vectorized storage and retrieval, while datasets are collections of data sources that help organize and categorize them.

You can create data sources and datasets in two ways:

- **Method 1**: Create a dataset first, then add data sources to it.  

- **Method 2**: Upload data sources directly without specifying a dataset, and Powerdrill will automatically create a default dataset for them.


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Method 1">

    1. Make a request to `POST /v1/datasets` endpoint to create a dataset.

        **Example request**:

        ```python

        ```

        <Info>
         Replace the `x-pd-api-key` value with the API key you've obtained in [step 1](#step-1-get-your-api-key). 
        </Info>

        **Example response**:

        ```python

        ```

        Obtain the `id` value (dataset ID) from the response and save it for later use.
        
    2. Make a request to the [POST /v1/datasets/{datasetId}/datasources](api-reference/create-data-source) endpoint.

        **Example request**:

        ```python

        ```

        <Info>
        - Replace the `datasetId` value with the ID of the dataset you've created in the previous sub-step. 

        - Specify either `url` or `fileKey`, but not both. Use `url` to upload a file through a publicly accessible URL. For privately accessible files, use `fileKey` (this feature will be supported soon).
        </Info>

        **Example response**:

        ```python

        ```

        <Info>
         Repeat this sub-step to create multiple data sources in the same dataset.
        </Info>

    
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Method 2">
    Make a request to the [POST /v1/datasources](api-reference/create-data-source-without-dataset) endpoint.

    **Example request**:

    ```python

    ```

    <Info>
    Specify either `url` or `fileKey`, but not both. Use `url` to upload a file through a publicly accessible URL. For privately accessible files, use `fileKey` (this feature will be supported soon).
    </Info>

    **Example response**:

    ```python

    ```

    Obtain the `datasetId` value (dataset ID) from the response and save it for later use.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Step 4. Create a job

Now, after you've prepared a session and probably a dataset stuffed with data sources, you can create a job to start conversing with Powerdrill.

<Tip>
For the definition of job, see [What is a job?](enterprise/pricing/#what-is-a-job).
</Tip>

Make a request to the [POST /v1/jobs](api-reference/create-job) endpoint. 

**Example request**:

```python

```

<Info>

- Replace the `x-pd-api-key` value with the API key you've obtained in [step 1](#step-1-get-your-api-key). 

- Since this topic covers running a general job, set the `x-pd-api-agent-id` header to `GENERAL` (uppercase).

- Replace the `sessionId` value with the ID of the session you've created in [step 2](#step-2-create-a-session).

- To enable Powerdrill to retrieve information from your own data and provide responses specific to it, set the `datasetId` to the ID of the dataset obtained in [Step 3](step-3-create-a-data-source-and-a-dataset).

## More to know

For each new organization, Powerdrill Enterprise offers 500 general jobs for free. After the free quota is consumed, to run more general jobs, you must subscribe to Powerdrill Enterprise via the [POST /v1/subscriptions](api-reference/create-subscription) endpoint. 

**Sample request**:

```python

```

<Info>

- Replace the `x-pd-api-key` value with the API key you've obtained in [step 1](#step-1-get-your-api-key). 

- Set `targetID` to your team/project ID, `targetType` to `RPOJECT_GENERAL_MODE_PLAN`, `tier` to your desired tier. For more information about the resources provided by each tier, see [Pricing plans for general mode](enterprise/pricing#pricing-plans-for-general-mode).
