## Introduction

Are you finding yourself overwhelmed with raw data, struggling to discover the insights you need? Are your decisions based more on instinct rather than proves? Your solution is right here -- Powerdrill launches its new feature **Advanced Analytics**.

Advanced Analytics can generate visualizations such as charts and maps after analyzing raw data. With Advanced Analytics, all you need to do is to "tell" Advanced Analytics what you want in natural language and let it uncover the trends and patterns in your data.

And we are excited to announce its new capaiblity -- SQL Advanced Analytics. With this new capability, you can connect your SQL databases as your data sources for analysis. 


## How to use this feature

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use General Advanced Analytics">

    1. Sign in with [Powerdrill](https://powerdrill.ai/auth/signin).

    2. Select **Advanced Analytics** and select the files you want to analyze.

        Only CSV, TSC, and Excel files are supported. Up to 10 files can be uploaded at a time.

    3. Message Powerdrill to start your conversation over your dataset.

    If you just want to see the effect of Advanced Analytics before uploading your own data, you can try our demo to take a glimpse.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Use SQL Advanced Analytics">

    To use SQL Advanced Analytics, you must first connect your SQL databases to Powerdrill. Currently, Powerdrill supports two types of SQL databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL.

    <Tip>At Powerdrill, we prioritize the security of your data and privacy above all else. We have implemented robust security measures to ensure that your keys and passwords are never accessed or stored by our system.</Tip>

    1. Sign in with [Powerdrill](https://powerdrill.ai/auth/signin).

    2. In the left sidebar, select **Datasets**. 

    3. On the page that is displayed, click **+ Dataset** in the upper-right corner.

    4. On the **Create Dataset** page, click the **SQL Databases** tab.

        If this is your first time for using this feature, the platform will prompt you with a message to recommend you to configure the user you provide to read-only. For details about how to configure the user to read-only, see [Set user privileges to read-only](#set-user-privileges-to-read-only).

    5. Select your SQL database type. 

        - For PostgreSQL-compatible databases, select **PostgreSQL**.
    
        - For MySQL-compatible databases, select **MySQL**.

    6. Configure credentials.

        - If you choose the `General` form, you need to specify the hostname, port, and name of the database to connect.

        - If you choose the `Advanced` form, paste the domain name of the database to connect to complete the URL.
    
    7. Configure authentication information, including the username and password used to connect to the database.

    8. If the database is configured with IP allowlists or blocklists, ensure the IP addresses provided on the page are in the allowlists.

    9. Click **Test Connection**. If the connection is successful, click **Finish**.

    Now, you can message Powerdrill to ask questions about anything you want to know from your data.


    ### Set user privileges to read-only

    The detailed procedure varies with your database type:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="PostgreSQL databases">

        1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database as a superuser or a user with the necessary privileges to create roles and assign permissions. 
    
            For example, run the following command in the `psql` CLI:

            ```bash
            psql -U postgres
            ```

            Replace `postgres` with your superuser or administrative username.

        2. Run `CREATE ROLE` to create a role.

            ```sql
            CREATE ROLE readonly_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
            ```

            Replace `readonly_user` with the desired username and `password` with a strong password. Alternatively, you can run `CREATE USER` as a shortcut for `CREATE ROLE ... WITH LOGIN`.

        3. Grant the `CONNECT` privilege on the database to the user.

            ```sql
            GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <database_name> TO readonly_user;
            ```

        4. Grant the `USAGE` privilege on the schema where your data resides.

            ```sql
            GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO readonly_user;
            ```

        5. Grant the `SELECT` privilege on the tables in the schema.

            ```sql
            GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO readonly_user;
            ```

        6. Set default privileges to allow `readonly_user` has the `SELECT` privilege on tables created in the future.

            ```sql
            ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly_user;
            ```
        
        7. Check whether the user privileges are configured as expected in `psql`:

            ```bash
            psql -U readonly_user -d database_name
            ```


      </Tab>
      <Tab title="MySQL databases">
        1. Use a MySQL CLI to connect to your MySQL server as the root user or another user with sufficient privileges to create new users and grant permissions.

            Following uses the `root` user and the `mysql` CLI as an example.
        
            ```bash
            mysql -u root -p
            ```

        2. Enter the password as prompted.

        3. Create a user and set a password for the user. 

            ```sql
            CREATE USER 'readonly_user'@'<localhost>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
            ```
            
            <Tip>
            - `readonly_user` is an example only. Replace it as needed. 
            - If you want to allow the user to connect from any host, set *`<localhost>`* to `%`.
            </Tip>

        4. Grant the `SELECT` privilege on all tables in the database to the `readonly_user` user.

            ```sql
            GRANT SELECT ON <database_name>.* TO 'readonly_user'@'<localhost>';
            ```

        5. Make the privileges effective.

            ```sql
            FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
            ```
        
        6. Check whether the user privileges are configured as expected in `mysql`:

            ```sql
            mysql -u readonly_user -p
            ```

      </Tab>
