## Introduction

Are you finding yourself overwhelmed with raw data, struggling to discover the insights you need? Are your decisions based more on instinct rather than proves? Your solution is right here -- Powerdrill launches its new feature **Advanced Analytics**.

Advanced Analytics can generate visualizations such as charts and maps after analyzing raw data. With Advanced Analytics, all you need to do is to "tell" Advanced Analytics what you want in natural language and let it uncover the trends and patterns in your data.


## How to use this feature

Using Advanced Analytics is easy as it is provided as a ready-to-use Powerdrill App.

1. Sign in to Powerdrill.
2. In the left sidebar, select **Advanced Analytics**.
3. Upload your files to create a dataset for analysis as instructed.

    Currently, CSV, TSV, and Excel files are supported.

4. A dialog box is displayed. You can click **Describe Dataset** to warm up your conversation with Advanced Anlyatics by letting Advanced Anlyatics desribes your dataset. Or you can simply close the dialog box and write your prompt.

If you want to try the effect of Advanced Analytics before uploading your own data, you can try our demo to take a glimpse.
