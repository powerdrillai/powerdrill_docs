## How to use the AI Presentation Maker

1. Sign in to [Powerdrill](https://powerdrill.ai).

2. From the left sidebar, choose **Presentations**. You will be directed to a page similar to this:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/new-pre.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

    Alternatively, you can start directly from the home page:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/homepage.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>

3. Then, upload your file. For CSV/TSV/Excel files, you can upload up to 10 files at a time.

4. Now, all you need to do is waiting for the completion. This process takes just one or two minutes.

After the presentation is generated, you can download it as PowerPoint slides and customize the content locally.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/download-ppt.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

All generated presentations are stored on the **AI presentations** page. You can access them anytime by selecting **Presentations** from the leftside bar.
