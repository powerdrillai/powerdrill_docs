title: Dataset as ChatGPT Plugin
description: 'Publishes your datasets as ChatGPT plugins to interact with the OpenAI ecosystem'

## Introduction

This feature allows you to create your own dataset and upload your data into it. After your dataset is created, Powerdrill automatically creates a RESTful API that complies with the development specifications of the OpenAI ChatGPT Plugins (https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction) for the dataset. This way, you can install your own dataset as a plugin on OpenAI ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4-plugins) and use it within the OpenAI ChatGPT Plugins ecosystem. This is a zero-code approach to integrating your data with the OpenAI ChatGPT Plugins ecosystem.

## FAQ

### Why my plugin is not used by ChatGPT?

It may be because the "Description" field of your plugin are not properly written when you installed your plugin. ChatGPT relies on the description of the plugin to decide whether to use it or not. If this is the case, you need to optimize the description of your plugin. For more information about plugin descriptions, see [Writing descriptions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/writing-descriptions) in the OpenAPI documentation.

### How can I publish a public ChatGPT plugin?

To publish a public ChatGPT plugin that is accessible to other OpenAI ChatGPT plugin users, you need to submit your plugin to the review process while you are installing the plugin. For more information, see [Submit a plugin for review](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/review/submit-a-plugin-for-review) in the OpenAPI documentation.
