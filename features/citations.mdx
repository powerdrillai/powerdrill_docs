## Introduction

When you chat with AI, you always receives an answer, but is it **THE** answer? You might wonder.

To address the authenticity concern, Powerdrill now includes the Citations feature, offering transparent references to your dataset. 

With the Citations feature, you can:

- Know which segments of the answer are orignated from your dataset.

- Effortlessly pinpoint the referenced segment.

- Check all references in a well-organized panel.


## How to use this feature


1. Sign in to Powerdrill.

2. Select the dataset that you want to use or create a new one.

    If you're already in the middle of a chat, you can select or create a databset in the **Associated Dataset** area at the upper right corner of your chat session.

3. Ask any questions about your dataset.

4. If you want to know the source of a specific answer segment, click the number at the end of that segment. Then, you can review the source at the right-hand **Summary** panel.

    If you want to know all sources referenced in the answer, you can click *N* **Sources** at the rigt corner of the answer to expand the **Summary** panel.

5. After reviewing a reference in the **Summary** panel, you can click **Locate Answer** in the upper right corner to navigate to the corresponding answer.
