## Introduction

The **Dataset Sharing** feature provided by Powerdrill enables you to effortlessly share your datasets in a controlled, governed manner. With this feature, you can:

* Easily share your datasets (by email or copying an invitation link).
* Stop sharing anytime you want.

The invitee with whom you shares a dataset can only use the shared dataset in Powerdrill Apps to complete specific tasks, such as chatting based on the dataset. The invitee cannot view the content of the shared dataset, let alone modifying or deleting it.

Once you delete a dataset that you share with others, the dataset will become unavailable to all the invitees.



## How to use this feature


### Create a dataset

1. Sign in to [Powerdrill](https://powerdrill.ai).

2. In the left sidebar, choose **Datasets**.

3. On the page that is displayed, click the **+ Dataset** button on the upper right corner.

4. On the **Create dataset** page, configure the dataset, including the name and description (optional), and click **Continue**.

5. Upload your data.

6. Once the data synchronization is complete, your dataset will be ready for chat-based exploration.



### Share a dataset

1. On the **Datasets** page, find the dataset you want to share, click the share button in the **Actions** column.

2. In the **Invite** dialog box, specify the following required information:

    Access mode: Set it to **Anyone with the link can access** (default) or **Anyone with the link and the token can access**. 

    **Validity Period**: Set it to **1 Day**, **1 Week**, or **Permanent** based on your needs. Note that after the validity period expires, the dataset will no longer be accessible to anyone, except you.

3. If you want to send invitations by email, enter the emails in the **Share by Email** field, and click **Invite**. If you want to directly copy and paste the link to the invitees, click **Generate Invitation**, click **Copy and Share**, and then paste the invitation information to the invitees. Of course, you can use both methods at the same time.

### Stop sharing

1. On the **Datasets** page, find the dataset you want to share, click the share button in the **Actions** column.

2. In the **Invite** dialog box, change the access mode to **Stop sharing**.

3. In the **Stop Sharing** dialog box, click **Stop Sharing** to confirm the operation.
