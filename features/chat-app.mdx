## Introduction

ChatGPT has already shown exciting capabilities in understanding natural language and applying public internet knowledge. However, there is still room for improvement in its deep understanding of specific domains and private data. Fortunately, we can guide ChatGPT to better understand and answer questions using appropriate prompts. Furthermore, we can fine-tune OpenAI's LLM for specific domains and private data to enhance its understanding of domain knowledge and private data.

Building on this, Powerdrill has integrated several public apps that have been tailored to specific datasets. These apps have undergone **knowledge processing** and **knowledge index** building, enabling them to answer questions about these specific domains and data more accurately than ChatGPT with general LLM. This unique feature of Powerdrill provides a more precise and efficient solution for domain-specific inquiries, thereby bridging the gap between your data and AI.

With Powerdrill, you can leverage the power of AI to transform your data into a valuable knowledge base, surpassing the accuracy of ChatGPT and providing a more tailored solution for your specific needs.
