## Introduction

The LLM Chat Proxy with Dataset feature is an extension of the [LLM Chat Proxy](/features/proxy) feature. This feature allows you to interact directly with the data in your Powerdrill dataset using an OpenAI's chat client software or service. By using this feature, you essentially build an AI digital assistant based on your dataset knowledge base using OpenAI's chat client software or service.
