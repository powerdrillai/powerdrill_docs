## Introduction

The No-Code App Builder feature is a no-code approach that allows you to build Apps by using natural language. With this feature, all you need is to provide an App name and a piece of prompt written in natural language, and then your App is right here, ready to use. 

The No-Code App Builder supports two types of Apps:

 - **Text generators**: can generate high-quality text in response to given prompts.

 - **Chatbots**: are capable of providing accurate responses to inquiries.

## How to use this feature

The following example describes how to create a text generator on Powerdrill.

### Prerequisites

You have signed in to Powerdrill.

2. In the **Create App** dialog box, enter the App name, choose the type, and click **Continue**.
