## Introduction

The No-Code App Builder feature is a no-code approach that allows you to build prompt apps by using natural language. With this feature, all you need is to provide an app name and a piece of prompt written in natural language, and then your app is right here, ready to use. 

The No-Code App Builder supports two types of apps:

 - **Text generators**: can generate high-quality text in response to given prompts.

 - **Chatbots**: are capable of providing accurate responses to inquiries.


## How to use this feature

1. Sign in to [Powerdrill](https://powerdrill.ai).

2. In the left sidebar, choose **Apps** to enter the **Prompt apps** page.

3. In the upper right corner, click **+ Prompt app**.

4. In the **Create prompt app** dialog box, enter the app name, choose the type, and click **Continue**.

3. On the **Prompt setup** page, configure related information.

    If you set the type to **Text Generator**, parameters needed include:

    | Parameter | Description |
    | :- | :- |
    | Prompt | Used to guide your app's response. Click **Save** after setting it. |
    | Variables | The parameters you specify in your prompts. Variables are parameters that must be specified when using the app. The variables are automatically generated based on your prompt. |
    | Associated dataset | If you want your app to reference specific knowledge when generating content, click **+ Select** to associate the app with selected datasets. |

    <br/>


    If you set the type to **Chatbot**, parameters needed include:    

    | Parameter | Description |
    | :- | :- |
    | Prompt | Used to set your app's behavior. Click **Save** after setting it. |
    | Welcome message | The initial greeting displayed at the start of a conversation. |
    | Associated dataset | If you want your app to reference specific knowledge when generating content, click **+ Select** to associate the app with selected datasets. |

    <br/>    

4. Click **Finish**. 

Now, your app is ready to use.
