## Introduction

The No-Code App Builder feature is a no-code approach that allows you to build Apps by using natural language. With this feature, all you need is to provide an App name and a piece of prompt written in natural language, and then your App is right here, ready to use. 

Currently, you can use this feature to create text generators on Powerdrill. The support for chatbots is coming soon. If you want to try a chatbot on Powerdrill, you can use the built-in App named **Simple Chat** by following instructions provided in [Chat App over Dataset](/features/chat-app).

## How to use this feature

The following example describes how to create a text generator on Powerdrill.

### Prerequisites

You have signed in to Powerdrill. 

For more information about how to sign in to Powerdrill, see Step 1 in [Try Out Powerdrill in 3 Minutes](/quick-start#step-1-sign-in-to-powerdrill).

### Procedure

1. On the **Apps** page, click **+ App** in the upper-right corner.
2. In the **Create App** dialog box, enter the App name, retain the default setting **Text Generator** for **Type**, and click **Continue**.
3. On the **Prompt Setup** page, configure related information:
    a. In the **Prompt** field, write a prompt and click **Save**. The variables used in the prompt will then be listed in the **Variables** area.
    b. In the **Variables** list, set a simple value for each variable. Then, you can click **Run** in the **User Input Preview** area on the right. The example execution result will be displayed in the **Output Preview** area.
    c. (Optional) In the **Dataset** area, click **+ Add** to select datasets as the knowledge base for the App. After datasets are added, the App will generate text based on the datasets.
    
    The datasets can be your private datasets and datasets shared with you. For information about how to create a dataset, see Step 2 in [Try Out Powerdrill in 3 Minutes](/quick-start#step-2-import-your-data).
4. Click **Finish**. 

Now, your App is ready to use.

### More information

The execution results of your App are recorded as output history. You can click the button next to **Reset** to view and manage them.

If you're not satisfied with the variables you specify, you can click **Reset** to reset all variables to the default settings.

You can click the **Settings** tab of your App to modify your Apps settings, including the name, description, and prompt setup.
